# The Dream
The purpose of this project is to make a 2D platformer engine that will be used for something, with the initial intention of being able to be a "clone" of Risk of Rain. There are two main goals I have with it:
  1. Finally finish a project
  2. Have an extensively moddable engine

I probably won't achieve the second goal with satisfaction, as making a completely modular engine (to allow for user-made renderers, gamemodes, gameobjects, etc.) is a monumental yet fun and rewarding task. I'm reserving that for my already-in-the-works-but-shelved game(-engine). The code for that engine is already over almost 200 files and many, _many_ lines of code, somewhere in the fifty thousands.

I also have some secondary goals to achieve with this project.
  1. Learn how to make network (multiplayer)
  2. Learn more about making `ClassLoader`s and their security (don't want an enemy that starts deleting your files.)
  3. Make a fun game.

With regards to #2, there _will_ be an option to disable security for those of us who like those games that delete your files when you kill an enemy (ex. Lose/Lose and the doom version).
